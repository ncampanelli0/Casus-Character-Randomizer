# Casus-Character-Randomizer
My friend is making a tabletop RPG (named Casus). This is a program that generates random character stats that do not violate the ruleset in Casus.
This program runs on the command line.

To download a precompiled version, download the folder: Casus Character Creator Executable

This program currently generates the following:
character class
character race
character karma
character stats (generates stats differently based on character class, as classes are split into caster and non-caster)
