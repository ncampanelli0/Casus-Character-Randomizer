My friend is making a tabletop RPG (named Casus). This is a program that generates random character stats that do not violate the ruleset in Casus.
This program runs on the command line.

This program currently generates the following:

character class

character race

character karma

character stats (generates stats differently based on character class, as classes are split into caster and non-caster)
